# Optical flow convention

To define the optical flow warp around function.
There are two methods to express the optical flow:
- w/o warp around: ignore the ERP camera model, make the 360 image as normal images;
- warp around: make the pixel warp around.

# Panoramic Image Coordinate system

There is more detail about the corresponding coordinate system between the panoramic image can be found in [1].
