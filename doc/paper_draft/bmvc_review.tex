\begin{abstract}

Panoramic image is common input of , but it has drametic distortation at top and bottom of image, 
The previous optical flow method use KTN to 
But their method can not extend the conventiential optical flow method.
in this paper we propose a (??) method which project the panoramic image to perspective images mitigating the distortaion.
It 
1. Use Icosehedron Sampling to uniform sampling the panoramic image to generate tangent images.

2. The gnomonic projection give the 1-1 mapping relationship between the panoramic image and the tangent image at the sampling points.

And we will release code and dataset.
