% why
%Omnidirectional panoramic image (360° image) has shown promising and exciting usage in computer vision, robotic, etc. area advantaged by its 360-degree field of view, affordable and portable capture device.
Omnidirectional 360° images have found many promising and exciting applications in computer vision, robotics and other fields, thanks to their increasing affordability, portability and their 360° field of view.
%
%Meanwhile, the equirectangular format (ERP) image is the most common 360° image format for storage, processing and visualization.
The most common format for storing, processing and visualising 360° images is equirectangular projection (ERP).
%
% problem
%But the distortion generated by the nonlinear map from 360° image to ERP image is still a barrier to restrict ERP image used as easily as the conventional perspective image, especially the optical flow method have not been fully explored how to mitigate the distortion.
However, the distortion introduced by the nonlinear mapping from 360° images to ERP images is still a barrier that holds back ERP images from being used as easily as conventional perspective images.
This is especially relevant when estimating 360° optical flow, as the distortions need to be mitigated appropriately.
% method
%In this paper, we propose a tangent image base 360° image optical flow method, which leverages gnomonic projection converting ERP image to perspective images, uniformly sample ERP image by projection on regular cubemap and icosahedron vertices and hire global rotation warping to capture long-span motion.
In this paper, we propose a 360° optical flow method based on tangent images.
Our method leverages gnomonic projection to locally convert ERP images to perspective images, and uniformly samples the ERP image by projection to a cubemap and regular icosahedron faces, to incrementally refine the estimated 360° flow fields even in the presence of large rotations.
%
Our experiments demonstrate the benefits of our proposed method both quantitatively and qualitatively.
