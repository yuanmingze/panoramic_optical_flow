\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

The panoramic camera is popular (cite camera name).

We use the Equirectangular image is the most common format to store and process.

There are huge distortion at the top and bottom of the Equirectangular images, which is generated by the coordinate system mapping relationship, from Spherical to Cartesian coordinate system.

The gnomonic projection is common tool used in geography mapping a continued curved earth surface to a plane, meanwhile map the great circle to a straight line~\cite{todo}. (More explain why gnomonic projection is good).

Meanwhile, to make the spherical sampled uniformly, the tangent points (gnomonic projection center point) selected base on the Icosahedron , which split a sphere to 20 equal size faces.

In this paper there are x technical contributions:

1) propose a gnomonic projection based panoramic optical flow method to solve the error caused by the equirectangular image's large distortion;

2) Propose a face optical flow blending method which can reduce dramatically the discontinuity at the image boundary;

3) propose a icosahedron base projection point selection method, which make sample the spherical surface uniformly.
