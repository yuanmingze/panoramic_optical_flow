% 360 camera booming 
The commercial panoramic camera is popular such as GoPro, Insta360, etc.

% 360 video media editing and distribution booming 
360 video editing, distribution and display:
editing: Davinci Resolve, Adobe Premiere Pro, etc.
distribution: youtube VR https://vr.youtube.com/, Facebook360 https://facebook360.fb.com/
display: VR Headset: Oculus, VLC, almost video player.

% optical flow is crucial for 360 image editing, 
360 method a lot, IBR, detection, ..... \cite{omniphoto, }, in which the optical flow is crucial information (input).

% problem
ERP is part of the omnidirectional media format (OMAF) stander. \cite{hannuksela2019overview}, and common format of 360 images.
There is huge distortion at the top and bottom of the Equirectangular images, which is generated by the coordinate system mapping relationship, from the Spherical to the Cartesian coordinate system.

% compare existing method
There two 360 image processing pipeline KTN and tangent image.
The KTN (distort kernel to the ERP) just work on the CNN method.
Tangent image is less GPU mem, high-resolution image, and flexible for different method on 360 images (both CNN and conventional methods).

% out method key idea
The gnomonic projection is a common tool used in geography mapping a continued curved sphere surface to a plane, meanwhile, map the great circle on the sphere to a straight line on tangent image ~\cite{gnomic_projection}. (More explain why gnomonic projection is good).

Meanwhile, to make the spherical sampled uniformly, the tangent points (gnomonic projection centre point) selected base on the regular polyhedron (cube and regular Icosahedron).

% our paper contributions
In this paper there are technical contributions:
1) propose a gnomonic projection-based panoramic optical flow method to solve the error caused by the equirectangular image's large distortion;

2) global warping method to align the image, large span motion in 360 images.

3) Propose a face (tangent image) optical flow blending method that can reduce dramatically the discontinuity at the image boundary;

4) uniform sampling sphere surface (ERP image).with regular icosahedron base projection point selection method, which makes sample the spherical surface uniformly.
