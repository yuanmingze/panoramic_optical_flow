\subsection{Optical Flow}

%Energy Minimization:
The optical flow is formulated as energy minimization problem to find the most similiary pixel corresponding and regularization with local or global smooth term \cite{KroegTDV2016, HornS1981, BA}. 
Furthermore, \citet{BroxBPW2004} propose warp base method, to update the optical flow with multi-iteration from previous iteration optical flow warped image. 
And \cite{SunRB2010} use median filter in pose-processing step sharper objection boundary's the optical flow.

%Supervised Learning:
Leveraged by the machine learning method, the supervised learning optical flow methods were proposed.
FlowNet\cite{DosovFIHHGSCB2015} lift the correlation operation and multi-scale help the CNN effectively find the corresponding relationship from two RGB images. And the FlowNet2 \cite{IlgMSKDB2017} import warp operation between the cascaded FlowNet agents to increase the perception of large pixel motion.

%
\citet{TeedD2020a} use the recurrent network to update optical flow from the 4D correlation volume, 

%Unsupervised Learning:

\citet{AleotPM2021} propose a training data generation method, 
which use estimated depth to generate new view point image and optical flow from single still image, to train the off-the-shelf optical flow method.
This method propose for self-supervised learn pathway.

\subsection{Panoramic Image Processing}

% applications
Panoramic image have been used on 
depth esitmation\cite{wang2020360sd}, room layout etimation \cite{wang2021led2, tran2021sslayout360}, Semantic segmentation \cite{yang2021capturing}, render \cite{xu2021layout}, etc.
% problem
The panoramic image format converts the 3D scene to a 2D image with the non-linear project, but it introduces distortion in the 2D image, e.g. the equirectangular image format has larger distortion especially on the top and bottom of the image.

% sovle with projection method
%% cube map projection
\citet{SunSC2021} proposed HoHoNet is a versatile method, their LHFeat is squeezed per-column feature, used to predict whole image information (depth map, semantic segmentation and layout reconstruction) with IDCT. 
\cite{WangYSCT2020}

\cite{CoorsCG2018} use Gnomonic Projection to directly sample data from panoramic image, in this way they transform the omnidirectional sampling to perspective's.
% icosahedron
\cite{EderPVBF2019}\citet{EderSLF2020} Icosahedron is used to averagely sampling from the panoramic image, to make less overlap area between each sampling area.

\subsection{Panoramic Datasets}

% 360 Image dataset:
%% Real-world
- MatterportLayout dataset: https://github.com/ericsujw/Matterport3DLayoutAnnotation, labeled scene

%% synthetic dataset (CAD dataset)
The real word data rich and colourful, but it is very hard to estimate or measure the accurate segmentation, motion flow, etc. form the real word scene.

- 360D dataset:
- Structured3D: https://structured3d-dataset.org/, synthetic dataset,room layout estimation
- Omnidirectional Stereo Dataset: http://cvlab.hanyang.ac.kr/project/omnistereo/
- Realtor360: 
- SUMO

% 3D Mesh dataset:
So the 3D dataset is commonly haired to generate the ground truth data for training or performance evaluation, such as Habitat \cite{SavvaKMZWJSLKMPB2019}.

%% CAD dataset

Meanwhile, the real word photo image is hard to estimate accurate optical flow.
 currently don't have any public panoramic optical flow dataset is available.
