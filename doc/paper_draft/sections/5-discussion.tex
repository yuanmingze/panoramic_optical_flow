\section{Conclusion}

This paper proposes a 360° optical flow method using tangent images and global rotation warping.
The tangent images use gnomonic projection uniform sampling from an initial cubemap to the final icosahedron-base tangent images to overcome the equirectangular projection distortions. Meanwhile use the global warping method to align large motions, 
Finally, use the weight optical flow blending method to reduce discontinuities at face boundaries.

The result shows our method dramatic improve optical flow in 360° images and achieve state-of-the-art performance.

%%\textbf{Limitation \& Future Work}
%To sccelerate the projection and stitch step, with multi-thread or c++.
%Pixel-based warping to deal with non-rigid or un-egomoiton.
To reduce the runtime we will use the c++ and multi-thread to replace the current python and single thread implementation.
To improve our method performance on camera translation motion, we will replace the global warping method with the pixel-based warping method which will introduce both rotation and translation to global warping.
