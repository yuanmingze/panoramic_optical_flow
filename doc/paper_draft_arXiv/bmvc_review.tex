\begin{abstract}
\noindent
Omnidirectional 360° images have found many promising and exciting applications in computer vision, robotics and other fields, thanks to their increasing affordability, portability and their 360° field of view.
The most common format for storing, processing and visualising 360° images is equirectangular projection (ERP).
However, the distortion introduced by the nonlinear mapping from 360° images to ERP images is still a barrier that holds back ERP images from being used as easily as conventional perspective images.
This is especially relevant when estimating 360° optical flow, as the distortions need to be mitigated appropriately.
In this paper, we propose a 360° optical flow method based on tangent images.
Our method leverages gnomonic projection to locally convert ERP images to perspective images, and uniformly samples the ERP image by projection to a cubemap and regular icosahedron faces, to incrementally refine the estimated 360° flow fields even in the presence of large rotations.
Our experiments demonstrate the benefits of our proposed method both quantitatively and qualitatively.
